## PyTorch practises

Here is some of my practises on Deep Learning. Target to complete are:
1. ~~Basic Convnet Classification~~
2. ~~Transfer learning~~ 
3. ~~Custom Batch Normalization using only torch~~
4. ~~ResNet-34 implementation~~
5. ~~Cyclical Learning Rate~~
6. Image Segmentation using U-Net ( Work in progress)
